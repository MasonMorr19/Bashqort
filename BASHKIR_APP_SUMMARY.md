# Bashkir Language and Culture Learning App

## Project Overview

This application is designed to promote and preserve the Bashkir language and culture through an innovative learning approach that combines memory techniques with cultural education. The app uses the Memory Palace (Method of Loci) technique to help learners remember Bashkir vocabulary and cultural concepts by associating them with visual locations in a traditional Bashkir village setting.

### 2. Cultural Content Integration
- Essential Bashkir vocabulary with cultural context
- Historical figures like Salawat Yulaev
- Traditional practices like bortnichestvo (wild beekeeping)
- Epic literature like Ural-Batyr
- Traditional instruments like the Kuralay

### 3. Learning Techniques
- Visual mnemonics for better retention
- Phonetic transcriptions for proper pronunciation
- Cultural stories that provide context
- Spaced repetition for long-term memory

### 4. Interactive Experience
